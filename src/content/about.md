text1: The Research Software Alliance (ReSA) and the Netherlands eScience Center are hosting a two-day international workshop to set the future agenda for national and international funders to support sustainable research software.  

 

As the importance of software in research has become increasingly apparent, so has the urgent need to sustain it. Funders can play a crucial role in this respect by ensuring structural support. Over the past few years, a variety of methods for sustaining research software have been explored, including improving and extending funding policies and instruments. During the workshop, funding organizations will join forces to explore how they can effectively contribute to making research software sustainable.<br><br>Additional support to increase accessibility will be available on request. Online opportunities will be provided to contribute to discussions around and during the conference, and recordings of the plenary presentations will be made available.<br><br>Please note this workshop is open to national research funding organizations, by invitation. If you are interested in attending but have not received an invitation, please contact us at events@esciencecenter.nl

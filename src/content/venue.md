The workshop will take place at the [Dutch Hermitage Amsterdam](https://hermitage.nl/en/), a seventeenth-century building and national monument. 
There are several car parks and hotels within walking distance of the museum. The Hermitage Amsterdam is easy to reach by car and by public transport. 
You can also travel by boat: there is a landing right in front of the main entrance by the Amstel river. 
We recommend you take the [Hermitage's](https://hermitage.nl/nl/plan-uw-bezoek/adres-route/) advice on how to get there.
